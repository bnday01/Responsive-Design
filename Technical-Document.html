The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe.

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion. </p>

<p>Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a galaxy we call the Milky Way, which is one of hundreds of billions (perhaps trillions) of galaxies in the Universe. Many of these stars have planets. At the largest scale galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.</p>

        <p>
The Big Bang is a scientific theory about how the universe started, and then made the stars and galaxies we see today.</p>

<p>The universe began as a very hot, small, and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces), with no stars, atoms, form, or structure (called a "singularity"). Then about 13.7 billion years ago, space expanded very quickly (thus the name "Big Bang"). This started the formation of atoms, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. It was Georges Lema√Ætre who first noted (in 1927) that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point. The universe is still expanding today, and getting colder as well.</p>

<p>As a whole, the universe is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes. Cosmology is the study of how the universe began and its development. Scientists who study cosmology agree that the Big Bang theory matches what they have observed so far. </p>

<p>Fred Hoyle called the theory the "Big Bang" on his radio show. He did not believe the Big Bang was correct. Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it.</p>

<p>Scientists base the Big Bang theory on many different observations. The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxies. Redshift is the Doppler effect occurring in light. When an object moves away from Earth, its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are, because the movement stretches the wavelength of light given off by the object. Scientists use the word "red hot" to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible spectrum. The more redshift there is, the faster the object is moving away. By measuring the redshift, scientists proved that the universe is expanding, and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth. With very exact observation and measurements, scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Because most things become colder as they expand, scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started.</p>

<p>Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of chemical elements in the universe. Amounts of very light elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang. Scientists also have found "cosmic microwaves background radiation". This radiation is known as radio waves, and they are everywhere in the universe. This radiation is now very weak and cold, but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot.</p>

<p>It could be said that time had no meaning before the Big Bang. If the Big Bang was the beginning of time, then there was no universe before the Big Bang, since there could not be any "before" if there was no time! Other ideas state that the Big Bang was not the beginning of time 13.8 billion years ago. Instead, some believe that there was a completely different universe before the Big Bang, and it may have been very different from the one we know today.</p>

      <article>
        <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">Gravity</h3>
        <p>Gravitation is by far the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale, where electromagnetic interactions dominate. But the idea that the weakness of gravity can easily be demonstrated by suspending a pin using a simple magnet (such as a refrigerator magnet) is fundamentally flawed. The only reason the magnet is able to hold the pin against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth is due to its relative proximity. There is clearly a short distance of separation between magnet and pin where a breaking point is reached, and due to the large mass of Earth this distance is disappointingly small.</p>

<p>Thus gravitation is very important for macroscopic objects and over macroscopic distances for the following reasons. Gravitation:</p>

        <dl>
  <li>Is the only interaction that acts on all particles having mass, energy and/or momentum</li>
  <li>Has an infinite range, like electromagnetism but unlike strong and weak interaction</li>
  <li>Cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against</li>
  <li>Always attracts and never repels (see function of geodesic equation in general relativity)</li>
        </dl>

<p>Even though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravitation, electrostatic attraction is not relevant for large celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies, simply because such bodies contain equal numbers of protons and electrons and so have a net electric charge of zero. Nothing "cancels" gravity, since it is only attractive, unlike electric forces which can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, all objects having mass are subject to the gravitational force, which only attracts. Therefore, only gravitation matters on the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>

<p>The long range of gravitation makes it responsible for such large-scale phenomena as the structure of galaxies and black holes and it retards the expansion of the universe. Gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena on more modest scales, such as planetary orbits, as well as everyday experience: objects fall; heavy objects act as if they were glued to the ground, and animals can only jump so high.</p>

      <h3>Electromagnetism</h3>
      <article>
        <p>Electromagnetism is the force that acts between electrically charged particles. This phenomenon includes the electrostatic force acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and magnetic forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.</p>

<p>Electromagnetism has infinite range like gravity, but is vastly stronger, and therefore describes a number of macroscopic phenomena of everyday experience such as; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Friction</li>
    <li>Rainbows</li>
    <li>Lightning</li>
    <li>All human-made devices using electric current, such as television, lasers, and computers.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic levels, properties of the chemical elements, including all chemical bonding.</p>
      </article>
      <h3>Strong Nuclear Force</h3>
      <article>
         <p>Two positive charges repel each other because of the electromagnetic force, so the strong nuclear force lives up to its name by overcoming the intense repulsion between similarly charged particles that coexist in the nucleus of atoms. When the strong nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons in an atom is broken, extreme high-energy photons are released in the process.</p>
      </article>

        <h3>Weak Nuclear Force</h3>
 <article>
        <p>The weak nuclear force can change a neutron into a proton in a process called nuclear decay. When the weak nuclear force converts a neutrally charged neutron into a positively charged proton, sub-atomic particles are released near the speed of light.</p>

<p>When the nuclei of atoms smash together or break apart, they often change their mass in the process. This gain or loss of mass corresponds to a loss or gain of energy, as well. The strong and weak nuclear forces are what enable fission and fusion energy to create the devastating power of nuclear weapons, as well as powering the core of stars.</p></article>

<header><h2>Science of the Small</h2></header>      <article>
       <p> Atoms are the basic units of matter and the defining structure of elements. The term "atom" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. We now know that atoms are made up of three particles: protons, neutrons and electrons ‚Äî which are composed of even smaller particles such as quarks.</p>

<p>Atoms were created after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. As the hot, dense new universe cooled, conditions became suitable for quarks and electrons to form. Quarks came together to form protons and neutrons, and these particles combined into nuclei. This all took place within the first few minutes of the universe's existence.</p>
        <p>It took 380,000 years for the universe to cool down enough to slow down the electrons so that the nuclei could capture them to form the first atoms. The earliest atoms were primarily hydrogen and helium, which are still the most abundant elements in the universe. Gravity eventually caused clouds of gas to coalesce and form stars, and heavier atoms were (and still are) created within the stars and sent throughout the universe when the star exploded (supernova).</p>
      </article>

    <section id="Atomic_Particles" class="main-section">
<header><h2>Atomic Particles</h2></header>      <article>
        <p>Protons and neutrons are heavier than electrons and reside in the nucleus at the center of the atom. Electrons are extremely lightweight and exist in a cloud orbiting the nucleus. The electron cloud has a radius 10,000 times greater than the nucleus.</p>

<p>Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass. However, one proton weighs more than 1,800 electrons. Atoms always have an equal number of protons and electrons, and the number of protons and neutrons is usually the same as well. Adding a proton to an atom makes a new element, while adding a neutron makes an isotope, or heavier version, of that atom.</p>
      </article>
      <h3>Nucleus</h3>
        <article>
<p>The nucleus was discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand, who in 1920 proposed the name proton for the positively charged particles of the atom. Rutherford also theorized that there was also a neutral particle within the nucleus, which James Chadwick, a British physicist and student of Rutherford, was able to confirm in 1932.<p/>

<p>Virtually all the mass of the atom resides in the nucleus. The protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus are approximately the same mass (the proton is slightly less) and have the same angular momentum, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>

<p>The nucleus is held together by the "strong force," one of the four basic forces in nature. This force between the protons and neutrons overcomes the repulsive electrical force that would, according to the rules of electricity, push the protons apart otherwise. Some atomic nuclei are unstable because the binding force varies for different atoms based on the size of the nucleus. These atoms will then decay into other elements, such as carbon-14 decaying into nitrogen-14.</p>
      </article>

        <h3>Protons</h3>
        <article>
<p>Protons are positively charged particles found within atomic nuclei. Rutherford discovered them in experiments with cathode-ray tubes conducted between 1911 and 1919. Protons are slightly smaller in mass than neutrons with a relative mass of 0.9986 (as compared with the mass of the neutron being 1) or about 1.673x10-27 kg.</p>

<p>The number of protons in an atom defines what element it is. For example, carbon atoms have six protons, hydrogen atoms have one and oxygen atoms have eight. The number of protons in an atom is referred to as the atomic number of that element. The number of protons in an atom also determines the chemical behavior of the element. The Periodic Table of the Elements arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number.</p>

<p>Three quarks make up each proton ‚Äî two "up" quarks (each with a 2/3 positive charge) and one "down" quark (with a 1/3 negative charge) ‚Äî and they are held together by other subatomic particles called gluons, which are massless.</p>
      </article>
      <h3>Electrons</h3>
        <article>
<p>Electrons are tiny compared to protons and neutrons, over 1,800 times smaller than either a proton or a neutron. Electrons have a relative mass of 0.0005439 (as compared with the mass of a neutron being 1) or about 9.109x10-31 kg. </p>

<p>J.J. Thomson, a British physicist, discovered the electron in 1897. Originally known as "corpuscles," electrons have a negative charge and are electrically attracted to the positively charged protons. Electrons surround the atomic nucleus in pathways called orbitals, an idea that was put forth by Erwin Schr√∂dinger, an Austrian physicist, in the 1920s. Today, this model is known as the quantum model or the electron cloud model. The inner orbitals surrounding the atom are spherical but the outer orbitals are much more complicated.</p>

<p>An atom's electron configuration is the orbital description of the locations of the electrons in a typical atom. Using the electron configuration and principles of physics, chemists can predict an atom's properties, such as stability, boiling point and conductivity.</p>

<p>Typically, only the outermost electron shells matter in chemistry. The inner electron shell notation is often truncated by replacing the longhand orbital description with the symbol for a noble gas in brackets. This method of notation vastly simplifies the description for large molecules.</p>

      </article>
<h3>Neutrons</h3>
  <article>
<p>The neutron is used as a comparison to find the relative mass of protons and electrons (so it has a relative mass of 1) and has a physical mass of 1.6749x10-27 kg.</p>

<p>The neutron's existence was theorized by Rutherford in 1920 and discovered by Chadwick in 1932. Neutrons were found during experiments when atoms were shot at a thin sheet of beryllium. Subatomic particles with no charge were released ‚Äì the neutron.</p>

<p>Neutrons are uncharged particles found within all atomic nuclei (except for hydrogen-1). A neutron's mass is slightly larger than that of a proton. Like protons, neutrons are also made of quarks ‚Äî one "up" quark (with a positive 2/3 charge) and two "down" quarks (each with a negative 1/3 charge).</p>

<header><h2>Laws of Physics</h2></header>      <article>
        <p>Over the years, one thing scientists have discovered is that nature is generally more complex than we give it credit for. The laws of physics are considered fundamental, although many of them refer to idealized or theoretical systems that are hard to replicate in the real world.</p>

<p>Like other fields of science, new laws of physics build on or modify existing laws and theoretical research. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, which he developed in the early 1900s, builds on the theories first developed more than 200 years earlier by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
      </article>
<article>
        <h3>Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton's groundbreaking work in physics was first published in 1687 in his book "The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy," commonly known as "The Principia". In it, he outlined theories about gravity and of motion. His physical law of gravity states that an object attracts another object in direct proportion to their combined mass and inversely related to the square of the distance between them.</p>
      </article>
        <article>
        <h3>Three Laws of Motion</h3>
<p>Newton's three laws of motion, also found in "The Principia", govern how the motion of physical objects change. They define the fundamental relationship between the acceleration of an object and the forces acting upon it.</p>

        <ul>
<li>First rule: An object will remain at rest or in a uniform state of motion unless that state is changed by an external force.</li>
<li>Second rule: Force is equal to the change in momentum (mass times velocity) over time. In other words, the rate of change is directly proportional to the amount of force applied.</li>
        <li>Third rule: For every action in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Together, these three principles that Newton outlined form the basis of classical mechanics, which describes how bodies behave physically under the influence of outside forces.</p>
      </article>
<article>
        <h3>Conservation of Mass and Energy</h3>
<p>Albert Einstein introduced his famous equation E = mc2 in a 1905 journal submission titled, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." The paper presented his theory of special relativity, based on two postulates:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Principle of Relativity</li>
        <p>The laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames.</p>

  <li>Principle of constancy of the speed of light:</li>
  <p>Light always propagates through a vacuum at a definite velocity, which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.
The first principle simply says that the laws of physics apply equally to everyone in all situations. The second principle is the more important one. It stipulates that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant. Unlike all other forms of motion, it is not measured differently for observers in different inertial frames of reference.</p>
      </article>
        <article>
        <h3>Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>

        <p>The laws of thermodynamics are actually specific manifestations of the law of conservation of mass-energy as it relates to thermodynamic processes. The field was first explored in the 1650s by Otto von Guericke in Germany and Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke in Britain. All three scientists used vacuum pumps, which von Guericke pioneered, to study the principles of pressure, temperature, and volume.</p>

 <ul>
   <li>The zeroeth law of thermodynamics makes the notion of temperature possible.</li>
<li>The first law of thermodynamics demonstrates the relationship between internal energy, added heat, and work within a system.</li>
<li>The second law of thermodynamics relates to the natural flow of heat within a closed system.</li>
<li>The third law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible to create a thermodynamic process that is perfectly efficient.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
        <article>
        <h3>Electrostatic Laws</h3>
<p>Two laws of physics govern the relationship between electrically charged particles and their ability to create electrostatic force and electrostatic fields.</p>
      </article>
        <article>
        <h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
<p>Coulomb's law is named for Charles-Augustin Coulomb, a French researcher working in the 1700s. The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the magnitude of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. If the objects have the same charge, positive or negative, they will repel each other. If they have opposite charges, they will attract each other.</p>
      </article>
        <article>
        <h3>Gauss's Law</h3>
        <p>Gauss's law is named for Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician who worked in the early 19th century. This law states that net flow of an electric field through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed electric charge. Gauss proposed similar laws relating to magnetism and electromagnetism as a whole.</p>
